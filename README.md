The Handwritten Digit Recognition project aims to develop a real-time system capable of identifying handwritten digits using machine learning and computer vision techniques. By leveraging a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the MNIST dataset, the system can accurately recognize digits drawn on paper or screen. This project uses Python and OpenCV to capture live video input from a webcam, preprocess the captured images, and predict the digits in real-time. The goal is to demonstrate how deep learning models can be integrated with computer vision to create interactive and intelligent systems
